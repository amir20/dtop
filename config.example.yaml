# Docker Monitor Configuration
#
# This file can be placed in one of the following locations (in priority order):
# 1. ./config.yaml or ./config.yml (relative to current directory)
# 2. ~/.config/dtop/config.yaml or ~/.config/dtop/config.yml
# 3. ~/.dtop.yaml or ~/.dtop.yml
#
# Command line arguments take precedence over config file values.

# Docker host(s) to connect to
# You can specify multiple hosts to monitor them simultaneously

hosts:
  # Basic host without additional fields
  - host: local

  # Host with optional name and Dozzle URL
  # - host: ssh://root@146.190.3.114
  #   name: Production Server
  #   dozzle: https://l.dozzle.dev/
